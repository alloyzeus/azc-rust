            # NOTE: changing the schema of bitfields is naturally more

            # An example use case for bitfield is to allow resource servers to

            # application can not be changed without changing the
            # identity of the application.

            # If we have 26bit identifier, and we want the whole ID num to fit

            # fits in 32bit signed integers), then substract it with the length
            # of identifier bits, in this case 26. So it will be: 32 - 1 - 26 = 5.
            # Five is the maximum size of the bitfield if we have 26bit
            # identifier and we want it to fit in 32bit integers.

            # For this particular case, we embed some information to the
            # IDs to help services handle requests from the applications

                    First-party applications, in contrast to third party

                    First-party applications could be in various forms, e.g.,
                    official mobile app, web app, or system dashboard.

                        There are two types of user agent based on the flow they use
                        to obtain authorization: public and confidential.
                        These types align with OAuth 2.0 client types (RFC6749

    documentation: |
      A Terminal is an authorized instance of application. As long the the
      authorization is still valid, a terminal could be used to access the
      service within the limit of the granted authorization. An
      authorization of a Terminal will become invalid when it is expired, or
      revoked by the user, if the terminal is associated to a user, or those
      who have the permission to revoke the authorization.

      After a Terminal authorization is invalid, their user must re-authorize
      their instance of Application if they wish to continue using their
      instance of Application to access the service. Re-authorization of an
      instance of an Application will generate a new Terminal. A
      de-authorized Terminal is no longer usable.

      A sucessful authorization will generate both a new Terminal and
      an initial Session.

      A Session represents authorization for a time span. While Terminal
      usually provide longer authorization period, a Session is used to
      break down that authorization into smaller time spans.

      If a Session is expired or revoked, the previously authorized
      Application instance (Terminal) could request another Session as long the
      Application's authorization is still valid. There's only one instance
      of Session active at a time for a Terminal.

      An access token represents a instance of Session.
