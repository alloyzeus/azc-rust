  - identifier: Terminal
    documentation: |
      A Terminal is an authorized instance of application. As long the the
      authorization is still valid, a terminal could be used to access the
      service. An authorization of a Terminal will become invalid when it
      is expired or revoked by the user, if the terminal is associated to
      a user, or those who have the permission to revoke the authorization.

      After a Terminal authorization is invalid, the user must re-authorize
      their instance of Application if they wish to continue using their
      instance of Application to access the service. Re-authorization of an
      instance of an Application will generate a new Terminal. A
      de-authorized Terminal is no longer usable.

      A sucessful authorization will generate both a new Terminal and
      an initial Session.

    documentation: |
      A Session represents authorization for a time span. While Terminal
      usually provide longer authorization period, a Session is used to
      break down that authorization into smaller time spans.

      If a Session is expired or revoked, the previously authorized
      Application instance (Terminal) could request another Session as long the
      Application's authorization is still valid. There's only one instance
      of Session active at a time for a Terminal.

      An access token represents a instance of Session.
