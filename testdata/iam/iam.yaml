      A Terminal is an authorized instance of application. As long the the

      authorization of a Terminal will become invalid when it is expired, or
      revoked by the user, if the terminal is associated to a user, or those
      who have the permission to revoke the authorization.

      After a Terminal authorization is invalid, their user must re-authorize
      their instance of Application if they wish to continue using their
      instance of Application to access the service. Re-authorization of an
      instance of an Application will generate a new Terminal. A
      de-authorized Terminal is no longer usable.

      A sucessful authorization will generate both a new Terminal and
